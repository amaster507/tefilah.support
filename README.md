## Introduction

Tefilah.support was the name chosen for this site after having a desire to help
myself and others strengthen how we pray, and pray specifically for world
missions. _Tefilah_ is the Hebrew word for "pray". So in essence, this site is a
prayer support site. We don't want you to merely recite prayers, or read through
a list of names. Our desire is to invoke and encourage you toward authentic
prayer with a burden on your heart for the world.

If you have been involved in church in any amount of time, you have most likely
been asked to pray for something or someone. There is no right or wrong way to
pray other than not to pray. But "teach us to pray" was a request from the ones
that literally walked the earth with Jesus Christ, the Son of God. May this site
be a blessing to you and encourage you to daily travel the world in prayer with
the Gospel of Christ.

## About

"Prayer partners do not need a passport." Prayer allows you to travel the world
in a few minutes per day. Through prayer you can travel from wherever you are
through your city, state, and around your country, down to Central and South
America, over to Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia, and back home in just a few
moments of time.

Tefilah.support wants to be your tour guide as your tavel the world in prayer.
Every week a different country will be chosen with daily prayer topics for that
country. On purpose we do not list specific missionaries or ministries, but we
encourage you to use your own resources or the links provided to find specific
missionaries and ministry works reaching the country of the week with the gospel
of salvation.

Every day there is a research task assigned to help guide you through the day
concerning missions. If you need help completing these tasks, please contact us.

### Our Backstory

On February 8th, 2025, Bro. John O'Malley with World Wide New Testament Baptist
Missions reached out to social media looking for a Creative in the group
_Creatives on Mission_ to design a printable PDF for churches on how to pray for
missionaries.

Bro. Anthony Master, a friend of Bro. John O'Malley was burdened by the content
for this proposed PDF. With permission, the 6 original prayer topics were
adopted into this web form with a 7th topic added to form a daily reminder to
pray for world missions.

This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages"
and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
Hope you dig it :)
